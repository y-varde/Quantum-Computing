    "(a) As we have seen in lecture, Qiskit allows you create a circuit consisting of the most commonly used quantum gates (e.g. X,Y,Z,CNOT etc.). Beyond this, Qiskit also allows you to arbitrarily specify the entries of a unitary matrix that you wish to insert in your circuit, for example using the Python package Numpy, and it will then figure out behind the scenes how best to implement the specified unitary using its native gates). \n",

    "Recall that in the CHSH game's optimal strategy that we saw in class, Bob makes a measurement in the basis $\\mathcal{B}_0 = \\{\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{8}) |0\\rangle +\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{8}) |1\\rangle, -\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{8}) |0\\rangle +\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{8}) |1\\rangle\\}$ if he receives question 0, and a measurement in the basis $\\mathcal{B}_1 = \\{\\cos(\\frac{-\\pi}{8}) |0\\rangle +\\sin(\\frac{-\\pi}{8}) |1\\rangle, -\\sin(\\frac{-\\pi}{8}) |0\\rangle +\\cos(\\frac{-\\pi}{8}) |1\\rangle\\}$ if he receives question 1. Moreover, recall from HW2 (Problem 1) that measuring in a basis is equivalent to applying an appropriate unitary transformation followed by a measurement in the standard basis. Let $B_0$ and $B_1$ be these unitary transformations for the measurements in the bases $\\mathcal{B}_0$ and $\\mathcal{B}_1$ respectively. In the following cell, define Numpy arrays corresponding to the matrix representations of $B_0$ and $B_1$. You may find the comments in the code helpful to guide you in the right direction if you are not familiar with Numpy."
